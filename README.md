hey, i'd thought it'd be neat to have a little extension that allows visitors to a site
to recommend other material related to the current site. like a shittier, totally manual
search engine. sometimes recommendations sourced directly from folks can be a lot better
than what google can dig up.

for example, if i'm reading an article about, oh i dont know, how deep learning works at a high level, i might be
reminded that daniel shiffman has some great beginner explanations of neural networks, and i might suspect that
other visitors to this article would appreciate knowing about dan's neural network videos. if i want, i can add a link
to his videos via the extension, and anyone else with the extension who reads the article will see that i suggested
his videos has a complimentary resource to understanding neural networks and deep learning.
